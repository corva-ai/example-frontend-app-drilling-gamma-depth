## @corva/ui
This repo contains components/utils which are shared for Corva ui apps.


#### Things to know:

1. How to bump the version? What should be the branch name? And other more advanced cases, like release/hotfixes. The guideline for all of these cases can be found [here (Corva access required)](https://www.notion.so/corva/corva-ui-d510f545ffb74c9bafd6b1bfbc0b99bf)

2. `yarn start` will open ExampleApp.js in your browser.
That's a playground for building components.

3. To link this repo with your app, you should:

    ### Mac
    1. Run `yarn build` or `yarn build-watch` in @corva/ui repo (only first time)
    2. Run `npm link dist` in @corva/ui repo root (only first time)
    3. Run `npm link @corva/ui` in your app folder

    ### Windows
    1. Run `npm config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\git\\bin\\bash.exe"`
    2. Run `yarn build` or `yarn build-watch` in @corva/ui repo (only first time)
    3. Run `npm link dist` in @corva/ui repo root (only first time)
    4. Run `npm link @corva/ui` in your app folder

    Note: npm link will not install @corva/ui dependencies in your node modules folder.
    If you want to debug a change  in @corva/ui dependencies, you should use `yarn add file:../corva-ui/dist`, this will install new dependencies.




### In case of issues with build
##### `You may have a problem with Invalid Hook Call Warning when you link library to app/another project;`

 In that case, your bundler might “see” two Reacts — one in application folder and one in your library folder. Assuming myapp and mylib are sibling folders, one possible fix is to run npm link ../myapp/node_modules/react from mylib. This should make the library use the application’s React copy.


 Or change the webpack configuration in config-overrides.js in your app. (Don't commit the changes of this file)

 {
    resolve: {
        alias: {
            react: path.resolve('./node_modules/react')
        }
    }
}
